Group project: Motion in a potential (on a rollercoaster)
=========================================================

My Role
-------

I built upon the code from another member on my team, ensuring it worked and added finding stable and unstable positions as well as their frequencies. I also had input on the other questions and the final poster.

turned up to most group meetings however we knew he was very ill so did
