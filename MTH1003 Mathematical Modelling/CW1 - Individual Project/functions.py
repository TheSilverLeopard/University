            You may well look at the below code and think to yourself "WHAT the bloody hell is this??",
            and you would be correct in judging it like that. However, once I've explained it, I hope that
            you won't judge it too hard anymore :).
            Okay, so...
                - "mul" is the function that I made up above,
                - "for j in range(len(self.xValues))" loops through values 0 to n, where n is the number of x values.
                - "if j != i" excludes the value i from the loop (where j == i).
                - "(_x - self.xValues[j]) /
                                (self.xValues[i] - self.xValues[j])" is essentially our (x_hat - x_j) divided by
                                                                     (x_i - x_j) - which is our Legrange formula.
                - "*[ ...CODE ]" - the square brackets [] define a for loop, following the same format as
                                 [(2 * i) for i in range(1, 4)] which would produce a list of [2, 4, 6, 8].
                                 In addition, adding an if statement:
                                 [(2 * i) for i in range(1, 5) if (i != 3)] would give [2, 4, 8, 10].
                                     Finally, the "*" unpacks the list returns into the function mul.
